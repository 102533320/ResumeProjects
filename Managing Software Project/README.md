## About This Project

People Health Pharmacy is a small pharmacy located at Hawthorn. They offer various medicine, health care products and accessories.They wanted to move the current paper-based system to a computer-based system and gain a better understanding of their sales (such as what item is out of stock, etc). This new system will help to track sales and produce reports, this will ensure that stock levels remain at a healthy level. The new system will save time and give a competitive edge over competitors.
